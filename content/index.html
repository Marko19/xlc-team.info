<p> <h1>Hi There!</h1> </p>
<p>We are the XLC Team, a robotic team from Slovakia. </p>
<p> Most of the time we build robots.<br />
Some of them <a href="/projects/robots/robots_soccer">play soccer</a>. <br />
Some are trying to act as rescuers. <br />
Some even <a href="/projects/robots/robots_dance">dance</a>. <br />
Nearly all of them participate in the 
<a href="http://robotika.sk/rcj">RoboCup Junior</a> competition.
</p>
<p>We also teach others how to build and program them.</p>
<p>Apart from that <a href="/projects/software">we build software</a> which makes it easier 
    to do what we do.</p>
<p>We do all of this because we can.<br /> 
And we can because we are <a href="/about#driven-by-passion">driven by passion</a>. <br /> 
And supported by our sponsors. And we would be really grateful if you could support us. </p>

<p>And we love to speak about what we do or just having an offtopic conversation. <br />
    So don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact</a> us.</p>
