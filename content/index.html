<p> <h1>Hi There!</h1> </p>
<p>We are the XLC Team, a robotic team from Slovakia. </p>
<p> Most of the time we build robots.<br />
Some of them <a href="/robots/soccer">play socer</a>. <br />
Some are trying to act as rescurers. <br />
Some even <a href="/robots/dance">dance</a>. <br />
Nearly all of them participate in the 
<a href="http://robotika.sk/rcj">RoboCup Junior</a> competition.
  </p>
<p>We also teach others how to build and program them.</p>
<p>Apart from that <a href="/projects">we build software</a> which makes it easier 
    to do what we do.</p>
<p>We do all of this because we can.<br /> 
And we can because we are <a href="/about#driven-by-passion">driven by passion</a>. <br /> 
And supported by our sponsors. </p>
<p>And we would be really greatful if you could support us. </p>
