#### Rastislav Gaži 
*the leader* 

Mr. Gaži is the driving force behind the XLC Team. His energy, passion and
vision are visible in everything we created. As a team leader he makes sure we
have everything we need for our work. 

Apart from that, he makes sure we never forget that what we do should be fun 
first and everything else then.

#### Jakub Krošlák
*master of electronics*

#### Ján Ďurkáč
*master of the force*

The force is all around us. We can't touch it, we can't see it, we can just
feel it. And we can say the same about Johnny. He doesn't show up much in our
small lab (and so you can't see or touch him) but you can feel him in nearly
everything we created. 

He's got great ideas, even though they are not always well suited for this
world. The force is strong with this on.




#### Marek Šuppa
*the lead developer*

#### Adrián Matejov
*master of the {flash, todolist, you name it...}*



#### Martin Faltus
*master of screwing*

Have you heard about the Phantom of the Opera? Well, Martin is a lot like him.
We never know where he is but if he appears he's got a handful of solutions
to any problem. If you want to fix some broken electronics, 
rewrite some software or solve a global crisis you should definitely contact him.

#### Michaela Gažiová
