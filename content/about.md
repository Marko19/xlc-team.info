and other similar things.

#### Rastislav Gaži 
*the leader* 

Mr. Gaži is the driving force behind the XLC Team. His energy, passion and
vision are visible in everything we created. As a team leader he makes sure we
have everything we need for our work. 

Apart from that, he makes sure we never forget that what we do should be fun 
first and everything else then.

#### Jakub Krošlák
*master of electronics*

Robots (as well as computers) have two basic parts. The robot itself (hardware
and electronics) and his intelligence (software). But even if you had the best
intelligence in the whole universe, without the robot itself it's not very
useful. 

Fortunately we've got Jakub in our team who makes sure that there are robots we
can run our logic on. Despite being relatively young he already deserves the
title master.


#### Ján Ďurkáč
*master of the force*

The force is all around us. We can't touch it, we can't see it, we can just
feel it. And we can say the same about Johnny. He doesn't show up much in our
small lab (and so you can't see or touch him) but you can feel him in nearly
everything we created. 

He's got some great ideas, even though this world is not always ready for them.

The force is strong with this one. Maybe that's why they call him D'urikonX.



#### Marek Šuppa
*the lead developer*

#### Adrián Matejov
*master of the {flash, todolist, video, cable, music, photo, key, you name it...}*

A good team needs to be adaptable. Or there just has to be someone who is able
to fill the holes when they appear. 

Thankfully we have someone who does precisely that. His name is Adrián (he is
also known as adman or один) and is a man of many jobs. As you can see in above
he does pretty much everything but we should not forget that he also produces
some decent quality Python code.


#### Martin Faltus
*master of screwing*

Have you heard about the Phantom of the Opera? Well, Martin is a lot like him.
We never know where he is but if he appears he's got a handful of solutions
to any problem. If you want to fix some broken electronics, 
rewrite some software or solve a global crisis you should definitely contact him.

### Padawans

#### Michaela Gažiová
*the lead padawan*

Even though you might not believe this we also have a girl in our team! 

And guess what? She does some real programming! 


#### Dávid Fusan
*drunken master of wisdom*



#### Mário Kačina
*master of the bikes*
